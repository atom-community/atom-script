# Script

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/rgbkrk/atom-script.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/rgbkrk/atom-script)

**Run code in Atom!**

Run scripts based on file name, a selection of code, or by line number.

**NOTE**: Some grammars may require you to install [a custom language package](https://atom.io/search?utf8=✓&q=language).

You only have to add a few lines in a PR to support another.

## Installation

`apm install script`

or

Search for `script` within package search in the Settings View.

## Atom can't find node | ruby | python | my socks

Make sure to launch Atom from the console/terminal. This gives atom all your useful environment variables. Additionally, make sure to run it with the project path you need. For example, use

```
atom .
```

to get it to run with the *current* directory as the default place to run scripts from.

If you *really* wish to open atom from a launcher/icon, see [this issue for a variety of workarounds that have been suggested](https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script/issues/61#issuecomment-37337827).

## Usage

Make sure to run `atom` from the command line to get full access to your environment variables. Running Atom from the icon will launch using launchctl's environment.

**Script: Run** will perform a "File Based" run when no text is selected (default).

**Script: Run** while text is selected will perform a "Selection Based" run executing just the highlighted code.

**Script: Run by Line Number** to run using the specified line number. **Note** that if you select an entire line this number could be off by one due to the way Atom detects numbers while text is selected.

**Script: Configure Script** should be used to configure command options, program arguments, and environment variables overrides. Environment variables may be input into the options view in the form `VARIABLE_NAME_ONE=value;VARIABLE_NAME_TWO="other value";VARIABLE_NAME_3='test'`.

Also, in this dialog you can save options as a profile for future use. For example, you can add two profiles, one for `python2.7` and another for `python3` and run scripts with a specified profile, which will be more convinient than entering options every time you want to switch python versions.

**Script: Run with profile** allows you to run scripts with saved profiles. Profiles can be added in **Script: Run Options** dialog.

**Script: Kill Process** will kill the process but leaves the pane open.

**Script: Close View** closes the pane and kills the process.

To kill everything, click the close icon in the upper right and just go back to
coding.

**Script: Copy Run Results** copies everything written to the output pane to the
clipboard, allowing you to paste it into the editor.

### Replacements

The following parameters will be replaced in any entry in `args` (command and program arguments). They should all be enclosed in curly brackets `{}`

  * `{FILE_ACTIVE}` - Full path to the currently active file in Atom. E.g. `/home/rgbkrk/atom-script/lib/script.coffee`
  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_PATH}` - Full path to the folder where the currently active file is. E.g. `/home/rgbkrk/atom-script/lib`
  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME}` - Full name and extension of active file. E.g., `script.coffee`
  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME_BASE}` - Name of active file WITHOUT extension. E.g., `script`
  * `{PROJECT_PATH}` - Full path to the root of the project. This is normally the path Atom has as root. E.g `/home/rgbkrk/atom-script`

Parameters are compatible with `atom-build` package.

## Development

This is an [Open Open Source Project](http://openopensource.org/), which means:

> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit.

As for coding and contributing, rely on the atom [contributing guidelines](https://atom.io/docs/latest/contributing).
They're pretty sane.

#### Quick and dirty setup

`apm develop script`

This will clone the `script` repository to `~/github` unless you set the
`ATOM_REPOS_HOME` environment variable.

#### I already cloned it!

If you cloned it somewhere else, you'll want to use `apm link --dev` within the
package directory, followed by `apm install` to get dependencies.

### Workflow

After pulling upstream changes, make sure to run `apm update`.

To start hacking, make sure to run `atom --dev` from the package directory.
Cut a branch while you're working then either submit a Pull Request when done
or when you want some feedback!
